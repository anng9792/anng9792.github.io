    <div id="Introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Photography plays a crucial role in shaping the fashion industry, but not all fashion photography serves the same purpose. High fashion photography and commercial fashion photography differ significantly in their aesthetic, intent, and execution. While high fashion photography often embraces avant-garde, artistic expression, and conceptual storytelling, commercial fashion photography prioritizes accessibility, branding, and mass-market appeal. These two branches of photography influence consumer culture and shape the visual identity of brands across the fashion spectrum.</p>

        <h2>Definition & Purpose</h2>
        <h3>High Fashion Photography
        </h3>
        <p>High fashion photography is an art-driven form of photography that showcases designer clothing, accessories, and concepts in an extravagant, imaginative, and often surreal manner. The goal is to push artistic boundaries, create a sense of exclusivity, and craft editorial images that evoke strong emotions or narratives. This type of photography is commonly seen in high-end fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harperâ€™s Bazaar, and Elle.</p>
        <p>Notable high fashion photographers include:
